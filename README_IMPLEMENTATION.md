## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Blank screen on launch
**Solution:** Open browser console (F12) → Check for errors → Most likely Firebase config not added

### Issue: "Permission denied" in Firestore
**Solution:** Add security rules in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules tab

### Issue: Authentication not working
**Solution:** Firebase Console → Authentication → Ensure Email/Password is enabled

### Issue: Can't add links
**Solution:** 
1. Check Firebase config is correct
2. Check Firestore database is created
3. Check security rules are added
4. Check user is logged in (console.log in AuthContext)

### Issue: Search not working
**Solution:** Search is client-side, should work instantly. Check browser console for errors.

### Issue: NPM vulnerabilities warning
**Solution:** This is normal for React projects. Run `npm audit fix` if concerned, but not blocking.
